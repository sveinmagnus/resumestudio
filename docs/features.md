# Features

A tour of what Resume Studio does today. Most of these are visible the moment
you open the app — nothing here is buried behind config files.

## Editing

- **Dual-language side-by-side editing.** Every translatable field renders as
  two inputs at once. Pick any two of your supported locales as primary and
  secondary, swap them with one click, or hide the secondary column when you
  want to focus.
- **Translation assist on every field.** Each secondary input has a **Copy
  from primary** button (no network) and, when a translation provider is
  configured, a **Draft translation** button that pre-fills a machine
  translation for you to review. Drafts are always flagged as review-required.
- **Multiple translation providers.** LibreTranslate (Docker-managed local
  instance, or a remote URL you host), DeepL, Google Cloud Translation, or
  Microsoft Azure Translator. Switch between them from Settings.
- **Re-detect languages.** A refresh button in the language switcher scans
  your content and adds any locale it finds to your supported list — handy
  after importing a CV.
- **Rich text where it matters.** Project and role descriptions support
  bold, italic, underline, and bullet/numbered lists.
- **Profile photo and company logo.** Uploaded, downscaled in-browser,
  embedded in exports.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** on every section, with keyboard up/down
  buttons retained for accessibility.
- **Undo / Redo** with debounced history (Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z).
- **Global search** (Ctrl/Cmd+K) across every section, skill, role, and the
  header — jump straight to any item.
- **Career timeline.** An overview chart of employments, education, and
  projects, with work-history-gap detection and a full-width zoom.
- **Freshness warnings.** The overview flags expired or expiring
  certifications and suspiciously long "ongoing" items; anything you've
  checked can be snoozed for a year.

## Skills, roles & categories

- **Shared registries.** Skills, roles, and industries live once and are
  referenced everywhere — rename a skill and every project updates.
- **Registry merge.** The "Løsningarkitekt" vs "Løsningsarkitekt" problem:
  pick one as canonical, the other gets rewritten everywhere it's referenced
  and removed.
- **Skill categories & showcase.** Group skills into your own categories
  (drag-and-drop between them), highlight the ones to showcase, and the
  exported "Skills Showcase" section builds itself from those choices.
- **Curated skill library.** Autocomplete against 1,200+ canonical skill
  names so imports and typing don't mint near-duplicates; related-skill
  suggestions; one-click **auto-categorization** of uncategorized skills —
  offline, no service involved.
- **Skill matrix.** An exportable skill × years × proficiency × last-used
  table derived from your project history.

## Multi-resume

- **One app, many master CVs.** Keep separate CVs for different lines of
  work, joint ventures, or career chapters. The picker is the home screen;
  each CV has its own URL, history, and supported languages.
- **Per-resume language pair.** Each CV remembers which two languages you
  were last editing in.

## Resume Views — targeted exports

- **Curated subsets of the master CV.** A view names a set of sections to
  include, items to exclude, a starred-only toggle, and a custom intro.
- **Per-section detail levels.** Each section can be Off, Summary, or Full —
  so a one-pager and a deep technical CV share the same source data.
- **Per-view styling.** Density, body size, heading font, accent color, page
  margin, tag style — all stored on the view, not the master CV.
- **Configurable header and footer.** Choose which contact fields appear,
  the labels and separators, name/title type size, photo and logo placement,
  and a footer note.
- **Live preview pane.** The document re-renders as you tune the view, with a
  page-count estimate against your page limit.
- **Export templates.** Named presets (compact technical, formal management,
  minimal one-pager) that seed a view's style, header/footer, and section
  detail in one click.
- **Job-posting tailoring — bring your own AI.** Paste a job posting, get a
  prompt to run in any LLM you already use, paste the answer back, and the
  view reorders and trims itself for that role. No API key, no data sent
  anywhere by the app.
- **Anonymized variants.** A per-view toggle that anonymizes customers and
  redacts references to initials — for tenders and broker submissions.
- **Per-view export language** — the same view can ship in English to one
  client and Norwegian to another.
- **Promoted Projects** and **Skill Matrix** as synthetic sections — surface
  starred projects or a skills table without restructuring the master.

## Export

- **PDF** via the browser's print pipeline — uses the system's native
  Save-as-PDF, so the result matches what you see in the preview.
- **DOCX** (`.docx`) via the [`docx`](https://docx.js.org/) library, lazy-
  loaded so the bundle only grows when you actually export.
- **Plain text & Markdown** — ATS-friendly exports for application portals
  that mangle formatted documents.

## Import & backup

- **CVpartner JSON import.** The importer handles both shapes CVpartner
  emits (object and interleaved-array localized values), normalises `int` →
  `en`, scans content for under-declared locales, and links projects to work
  experiences through the source IDs.
- **LinkedIn import.** Drop the LinkedIn data-export `.zip` on the picker and
  get a working resume.
- **Europass import.** Reads both SkillsPassport XML and Europass profile
  JSON.
- **AI-assisted import from PDF or Word — bring your own AI.** Download the
  instruction template, run it with your CV in any LLM, paste the JSON back,
  and preview the result before it becomes a resume. Your CV goes only to the
  AI *you* chose.
- **Portable JSON backup.** Per-resume export from the editor; versioned
  format with a migration scaffold so older backups keep loading.
- **Server-side snapshot history.** Every save is snapshotted (last 50 per
  resume, duplicates skipped). The header's **History** button restores any
  version — and the restore itself is undoable.

## Persistence & offline tolerance

- **Auto-save** to a local SQLite database (debounced ~1 s).
- **localStorage fallback** per resume, so a momentary outage never costs
  work. Edits flush the moment the server returns.
- **Status visible in the header** — Saving / Saved / Offline / Queued /
  Conflict, with a count of any resumes still waiting to sync.
- **Optimistic concurrency.** If two devices race on the same resume, the
  loser sees a non-blocking **Conflict** modal with a labelled diff and a
  keep-mine / discard-mine choice.

## Cross-computer sync (desktop)

- **Backup folder in your existing cloud sync** (Google Drive, Dropbox,
  OneDrive). Resume Studio writes a single JSON file there, atomically, and
  merges newer content from it on every launch.
- **Newest-wins per resume, never deletes.** Safe by design — a restore
  drops a snapshot first, so it's reversible from History.
- **No real-time multi-writer.** Designed for one person hopping between
  computers, not for two people editing the same CV at once.
- **Automatic updates.** The desktop app checks GitHub Releases daily (or on
  demand from the tray / Settings) and installs a new version in place with
  one click — no reinstall, your data untouched.

## Privacy & security posture

- **Your CV never leaves your machine** unless you turn translation on, in
  which case the chosen provider sees only the text fragments you draft.
- **No account, no telemetry, no analytics.**
- **Loopback-only on desktop.** The local server binds `127.0.0.1` — the app
  is never exposed to your network.
- **Auth-gated when self-hosted.** Server deployments require a bearer token;
  the browser exchanges it for an HttpOnly session cookie so the token never
  lives in JavaScript-readable storage.
- **Content sanitised at the render boundary.** Rich text, view styling, and
  imported view configs are sanitised before they reach the export or preview
  pipelines.
