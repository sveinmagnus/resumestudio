/**
 * Process-wide holder for the active BackupScheduler.
 *
 * The launcher starts the periodic backup writer at boot, but the in-app
 * Settings screen can change the backup folder/interval at runtime — and the
 * route handler (which lives outside the launcher) needs a way to restart the
 * scheduler with the new config. This tiny module is that handoff point: the
 * launcher seeds it, the settings route calls `reconfigureBackup`, and shutdown
 * flushes/stops through it.
 *
 * Desktop-only in practice (the VPS build never seeds it), so on a server these
 * functions are inert unless something deliberately calls reconfigure.

 * machines' edits IN whenever a sync service updates the file (so a
 * long-running background server doesn't only merge at launch). Both are gated
