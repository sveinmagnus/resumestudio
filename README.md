# Resume Studio

A multi-language consultant resume manager. Maintain one master CV across
languages, then export targeted variants — PDF or Microsoft Word — for
different audiences.

Built for a single consultant; runs as a small self-hosted web app (React +
Express + SQLite) with offline-tolerant persistence.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens the client on `http://localhost:5173` and the API on `http://localhost:3001`.

For production:

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # set RESUME_API_TOKEN for a deployed instance
npm run build
npm start                  # serves dist/ + API from the same Express process
```

On Windows, if PowerShell blocks scripts, use `npm.cmd` instead of `npm`, or
run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.

## What's in the box

### Editing
- **Dual-language side-by-side editing.** Every translatable field renders as
  two inputs at once — pick any two of your supported locales, swap with one
  click, hide the secondary column when you want focus.
- **Re-detect languages.** A refresh button in the language switcher scans
  the content and adds any new locale it finds to your supported list.
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** on every section that has a sort order, with
  keyboard up/down buttons retained for accessibility.
- **Undo / Redo** (Ctrl/Cmd+Z, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z) with debounced history.
- **Skill / role registry merge** — the "Løsningarkitekt" vs
  "Løsningsarkitekt" problem: pick one as the canonical entry, the other
  gets rewritten into it and removed.

### Persistence
- **Auto-save to a SQLite-backed Express server** (debounced 1 s).
- **localStorage fallback** so a server outage doesn't cost you work — your
  edits flush to the server the moment it returns.
- **Status visible in the header**: Saving / Saved / Save failed (with
  Retry) / Local only.
- **Portable JSON backup** — "Save to file" downloads a versioned backup;
  "Load file" restores from a backup *or* imports a CVpartner JSON export.

### Export
- **Resume Views** — curated subsets of the master CV. Pick which sections
  to include, exclude individual items, toggle "starred only", add a custom
  introduction.
- **PDF** via the browser's print pipeline.
- **DOCX** (.docx) via the [`docx`](https://docx.js.org/) library, lazy-loaded
  so it only downloads when you actually click Export.

### Import
- **CVpartner JSON** exports. The importer handles both shapes CVpartner
  emits (object + interleaved-array localized values), normalises `int` →
  `en`, scans content for locales the export under-declares, and links
  projects to work experiences through the source IDs.

## Architecture

```
React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
  ├── Zustand store (single source of in-memory state)
  ├── Express + better-sqlite3 (single-row resume_store table)
  └── localStorage cache (fallback)
```

Detailed conventions live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) — read that before
making non-trivial changes.

### Layout
```
src/
├── types/       single source of truth for the data model
├── store/       Zustand store + undo/redo hook
├── lib/         pure logic: importer, exporter, viewFilter, backup, locales,
│                completeness, merge, localCache, api, sections
├── components/  React UI (layout, ui primitives, per-section editors)
└── App.tsx      routes the active section to the right editor

server/          Express API + SQLite persistence
tests/           Vitest specs (179 tests, all green)
```

## Scripts

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Concurrently runs Vite (5173) and Express (3001) |
| `npm run build` | Production client bundle to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve `dist/` to verify the prod build |
| `npm start` | Production: serves `dist/` + API from one Express process |
| `npm test` | One-shot Vitest run |
| `npm run test:watch` | Watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | v8 coverage report (HTML in `coverage/`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` for both client and server |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck + test + build on every push
and PR.

---

## Configuration

`.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RESUME_API_TOKEN` | empty | Bearer token required by the API. Empty = auth disabled (local dev). |
| `PORT` | `3001` | Express listen port. |

The SQLite database lives at `data/resume.db` (gitignored). WAL mode is on.
