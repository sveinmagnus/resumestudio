# Resume Studio — Desktop build & cross-computer sync

This is the downloadable, self-deployable build: a double-clickable launcher
that starts the app locally and opens it in your browser, with your data stored
privately on your machine and an optional one-folder backup that syncs across
computers via Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive.

It is the **same** Express + SQLite + React app as the server build — just
packaged so a non-technical user can run it without installing Node, and wired
to keep data in a stable per-user location with a safe sync story. The
architecture is unchanged, so a future move to Electron is repackaging, not a
rewrite (see CLAUDE.md §1 / the desktop notes there).

---

## 1. Building the portable folder

```
npm install
npm run build:desktop
```

This runs the client build and then `scripts/build-desktop.mjs`, producing a
self-contained `release/` folder:

```
release/
  node[.exe]                     ← the Node runtime (copied from your machine)
  Resume Studio.cmd              ← Windows launcher (shows a status/log window)
  Resume Studio (no window).vbs  ← Windows launcher, no console window
  resume-studio.sh               ← Linux/macOS launcher
  Resume Studio.command          ← macOS Finder-double-clickable (macOS builds)
  README.txt                     ← end-user quick start
  app/
    launcher.cjs                 ← the whole server, bundled by esbuild
    dist/                        ← the built React client
    node_modules/                ← only better-sqlite3 + its native deps
```

Zip `release/`, hand it to a user, and they unzip + double-click. No install.

> **Build on each target OS.** The bundled Node binary and better-sqlite3's
> compiled `.node` addon are platform-specific. Run `npm run build:desktop` on
> Windows to make the Windows build, on Linux for Linux, on macOS for macOS.
> There is no cross-compilation step.

### Quick local run (no packaging)

```
npm run desktop
```

Builds the client and runs the launcher straight from the source via `tsx` —
handy for trying the desktop boot/sync behavior without assembling `release/`.

---

## 2. Launching & stopping

Double-click the launcher. A small window appears showing startup logs and the
URL, your browser opens the app automatically, and a **Resume Studio icon
appears in the system tray** (notification area).

**To stop the app, use the tray icon** — right-click it and choose **Quit Resume
Studio**. The tray menu also has **Open Resume Studio**, which reopens the app in
your browser (handy after you've closed the tab).

> Why the tray, and not a button in the web page? Closing the browser tab does
> **not** stop the app — the little local server keeps running. And quitting from
> inside the web UI would be confusing: any other open tab would then start
> erroring. The tray lives outside the page, so Quit is unambiguous. Quitting
> from the tray runs a clean shutdown (final backup written, database closed
> safely).

Other ways to stop, if you prefer: **close the launcher window**, or press
**Ctrl-C** in it — both do the same clean shutdown. (The `.vbs` "no window"
launcher has no window to close, which is exactly why the tray Quit exists.)

If the tray icon doesn't appear (e.g. a minimal Linux desktop with no system
tray, or Docker-style headless box), the app still runs — just use the window /
Ctrl-C to stop it. The log notes when the tray is unavailable.

To make a Start-menu / desktop shortcut, create a normal OS shortcut pointing at
the launcher file. (On Linux you can write a `~/.local/share/applications/
resume-studio.desktop` entry whose `Exec=` is the absolute path to
`resume-studio.sh`.)

The launcher picks the first free port starting at 3001, so multiple things on
3001 won't collide, and writes the chosen URL into the window + log.

## 3. Where your data lives

The live SQLite database and a log file live in a **private per-user folder**,
deliberately *outside* the `release/` folder so you can move, replace, or delete
the app folder without touching your data:

| OS | Data folder |
|----|-------------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\ResumeStudio` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ResumeStudio` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/resume-studio` or `~/.local/share/resume-studio` |

Override with `RESUME_DATA_DIR` if you want it elsewhere.

The database keeps full snapshot history per resume (the in-app **History**
button), so accidental edits are recoverable independently of backups.

---

## 4. Settings

Click the **gear icon** (top-right of the resume picker) to open Settings. This
is where a desktop user turns features on or off — no shell variables, no
editing the launcher. It is one form with one **Save**; the tabs just organize
it. Changes land in `settings.json` in the data folder (§3) and take effect
immediately.

- **Version** — the installed version, **Check for updates**, and **Install
  update** (see §6).
- **Translation** (the "Draft translation" button on the second language) —
  pick a provider:
  - **Off** (default) — no machine translation. "Copy from primary" still works.
  - **LibreTranslate — local (Docker-managed)** — the app runs a LibreTranslate
    container for you via Docker. Requires **Docker Desktop** installed and
    running. You **choose which languages to install** (each is a
    few-hundred-MB download, so the first start takes minutes; English is
    always included — the engine pivots through it). Use **Start / Stop /
    Check status**, then **Save** to auto-start it on every launch. Nothing
    leaves your machine.
  - **LibreTranslate — remote URL** — an instance you host elsewhere, with an
    optional API key.
  - **DeepL** — paste a DeepL API key. Free and Pro keys both work
    (auto-detected from the `:fx` suffix). Best quality for
    Norwegian/Swedish/Danish.
  - **Google Cloud Translation** — paste an API key.
  - **Microsoft Azure Translator** — paste the key and its **region** (e.g.
    `westeurope`).
  - **Use the AI model from Summarize** — no config at all: translation drafts
    run on whatever model the AI assist tab configures.
  - For any provider except "off", **Test connection** drafts one short phrase
    to confirm the key/URL works. CV text only ever travels browser → this
    app → the chosen provider.
- **AI assist** — the model behind Summarize, every "Run with my AI" button,
  and (optionally) translation:
  - **Ollama — local (Docker-managed)** — the app runs an Ollama container and
    pulls your chosen model for you (Docker Desktop required; models are
    GB-scale downloads). Content never leaves your machine.
  - **Ollama — remote URL**, **OpenAI** (API key), or **any OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint** (URL + optional key — LM Studio, Groq, OpenRouter, …).
  - The **model** field offers a curated shortlist of open-weight models plus
    whatever your Ollama instance has already pulled (**Refresh** re-probes),
    and stays free-text so any tag works. **Test** runs one tiny summary.
  - Every AI button in the app states whether content stays on this computer
    or is sent to the configured provider, based on where the endpoint
    actually is.
- **Sync & backup** — the cloud-synced folder described in §5.
- **Appearance** — the app-wide default heading/body fonts that views with
  fonts set to "inherit" pick up.

> On a server (VPS) deployment the gear shows a read-only view instead: there,
> these are controlled by environment variables, not the app.

## 5. Backup & sync across computers

This is the recommended way to use one set of CVs on several machines.

**How it works.** In **Settings → Backup & sync folder**, set a cloud-synced
folder (Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive). Resume Studio then keeps a single
JSON file, `resume-studio-backup.json`, in that folder containing **all** your
resumes. It is written atomically (so the sync client never sees a half file):

- once at startup,
- whenever the store changes while running (about once a minute, only if
  something actually changed — no idle churn),
- once on a clean shutdown,
- and on demand from the picker's **Sync & backup** panel ("Back up now").

Resume Studio **merges in** anything newer from that file continuously while it
runs — not only at launch. It watches the backup file (and re-checks it on a
short interval as a backstop, since cloud-drive folders don't always fire file
events), so edits made on another computer land here within seconds of the sync
service delivering them, even if this machine has been left running for days.
It still also merges once at startup. So the typical flow is:

1. On computer A, open **Settings** and set the backup folder to e.g.
   `…/Google Drive/ResumeStudio`, then use the app normally.
2. On computer B, set the **same** synced folder in Settings. B pulls A's
   resumes in automatically (the log shows `sync-in: +N new` at launch, and
   `backup-watch: merged from sync folder` when it picks up a later change). If
   the resume you're viewing on B was updated on A, a small **"updated on
   another device — Reload"** notice appears above the editor.

**Merge rules (safe by design).** Merging is *newest-wins per resume*, keyed on
each resume's last-saved time, and a union across machines:

- A resume that's newer in the backup replaces the local copy.
- A resume you don't have yet is added.
- A resume that's newer locally is kept.
- **Nothing is ever deleted** by a normal restore. (A restore also drops a
  snapshot first, so you can undo it from History.)
- Your **shared skill registry** ("who knows what") rides along too, so if you
  share skills across resumes on one machine, the links come through on the
  others — merged by skill, newest name wins, never deleted.

This means it's last-writer-wins if you edit the *same* resume on two machines
without syncing in between — fine for a single person hopping between computers,
but it is not a real-time multi-writer collaboration system.

### Why not just put the database in Google Drive?

Because a live SQLite file (plus its `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars) inside a cloud-sync
folder is a known corruption trap: the sync client uploads the pieces at
inconsistent moments and two machines can clobber each other. The JSON backup
sidesteps that entirely — only a plain, atomically-written file syncs, and the
merge is deterministic. (If you really want the live DB in a synced folder
anyway, set `RESUME_DB_JOURNAL=TRUNCATE` so no WAL sidecars are left around —
but the JSON-backup route above is strongly preferred.)

### Manual / portable backups

Independent of the sync folder, the in-editor **Export backup** button still
downloads a single resume's portable JSON, and **History** keeps server-side
snapshots. The sync folder backup is the *whole store*; the export button is
*one resume*.

---

## 6. Automatic updates

Resume Studio keeps itself current from its **GitHub Releases**, with no
installer and no app store — the same self-contained portable folder, swapped in
place.

**How it checks.** The app checks for a newer release **once shortly after
launch and then daily**, and you can check on demand. The tray menu shows the
**installed version** in its header, then:

- **System tray** — right-click the Resume Studio tray icon. **"Check for
  updates"** is always available; click it to check now (a native popup reports
  "you're on the latest version" if there's nothing new). **"Install update"**
  sits below it and is greyed out until an update is ready.
- **When an update is found** (by the manual or the daily check) a pop-up
  appears — *"New version X available"* with **Install** / **Cancel**. Cancel
  just dismisses it; the update stays available via the tray's **Install update**
  item and the in-app banner.
- **In the app** — the resume picker shows an **"Update available"** banner with
  an **Install update** button (and a *Release notes* link); **Settings →
  Version** shows your current version with a **Check for updates** button; and
  the picker footer always shows the installed version.

**How it installs.** Click **Install** (the pop-up), or **Install update** (tray
or banner). The app downloads the new build for your OS, **checks it against the
SHA-256 published with the release** and refuses to install anything that
doesn't match, then a small **updater window opens and shows a progress bar**
while it swaps the files and restarts onto the new version. Your data is
untouched — it lives in the per-user folder (§3), not inside the app folder that
gets replaced.

**Cross-platform, by design.** This works on Windows, macOS and Linux without
Electron. Because a running program can't overwrite its own files (especially
the Node binary on Windows, which is locked while running), the install hands
off to a tiny helper script (a visible PowerShell window on Windows) that waits
for the app to exit, copies the new files with a progress bar, and relaunches.
On Windows the relaunch uses the **no-window launcher** (`Resume Studio
(no window).vbs`), so after an update the app runs without a console window —
exactly as if you had started it windowless yourself; quit it from the tray
icon as usual. The downloaded asset is a `.tar.gz` (extracted with the system
`tar`, present on Windows 10+/macOS/Linux).

> The desktop build is **not code-signed**. The updater swaps files inside the
> app folder you already trust and relaunches directly, which avoids the
> first-run Gatekeeper/SmartScreen prompts — but if your OS still warns, that's
> why. The checksum check catches a corrupted or tampered *download*; it is not
> a signature, so the GitHub release itself remains what you're trusting.
> Updates are a desktop-only feature: a server (VPS) deployment never
> self-updates (it reports "not supported").

**Turning it off.** Set `RESUME_NO_UPDATE=1` before launching to disable the
background check and the install action entirely.

## 7. Configuration reference

Most users never touch these — **Settings** (§4) covers translation and the sync
folder, with everything else defaulted. These env vars are an advanced/override
layer (set them in the shell or the launcher shim before launching). On the
desktop build, `settings.json` is authoritative: it's seeded from these on the
first run, then overrides them.

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `RESUME_DATA_DIR` | Where the live DB + log live | per-user OS folder (§3) |
| `RESUME_BACKUP_DIR` | Cloud-synced folder for the store backup (usually set via Settings) | unset (sync off) |
| `RESUME_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS` | How often to refresh the backup when changed | `60000` |
| `LIBRETRANSLATE_URL` | LibreTranslate base URL (usually set via Settings) | unset (translate off) |
| `LIBRETRANSLATE_API_KEY` | Optional LibreTranslate key | unset |
| `SUMMARIZE_PROVIDER` / `SUMMARIZE_MODEL` (+ per-provider URL/key vars) | AI-assist backend seed values (usually set via Settings → AI assist; see `.env.example`) | unset (AI assist off) |
| `RESUME_DB_PATH` | Exact DB file (overrides data-dir derivation) | `<dataDir>/resume.db` |
| `RESUME_DB_JOURNAL` | SQLite journal mode | `WAL` |
| `RESUME_CLIENT_DIR` | Where the built client lives | set by the launcher shim |
| `RESUME_COMPOSE_FILE` | docker-compose file for managed translate | set by the launcher shim |
| `PORT` | Preferred port (auto-advances if taken) | `3001` |
| `RESUME_NO_BROWSER` | Don't auto-open a browser (headless/CI) | unset |
| `RESUME_API_TOKEN` | Require a bearer token (not needed for loopback-only) | unset |
| `RESUME_NO_UPDATE` | Disable the auto-updater (background check + install) | unset (updates on) |
| `RESUME_UPDATE_REPO` | GitHub `owner/repo` to check for releases | `sveinmagnus/resumestudio` |
| `RESUME_INSTALL_DIR` | The portable build root to swap on update (set by the shim) | derived from `RESUME_CLIENT_DIR` |
| `RESUME_APP_VERSION` | The running version. Baked into the shim at build time — from the **git tag** in a CI release (which must match `package.json`), or `package.json` for a local `build:desktop`/`tsx` run | from `package.json` |

The server binds **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`), so the app is never exposed to
your local network.

## 8. Troubleshooting

- **Nothing opened in the browser.** The window/log prints the URL — open it
  manually. Pop-up/launch blockers can stop the auto-open.
- **Where are the logs?** `resume-studio.log` in the data folder (§3).
- **"Restore from folder" is greyed out.** No backup file exists in the sync
  folder yet — click **Back up now** on the first machine first (or let it run a
  minute), and make sure the cloud client has finished syncing the file down to
  this machine.
- **Moved the app and lost data?** You didn't — data is in the per-user folder
  (§3), not in `release/`. Set the same backup folder in Settings on the new copy
  if you also want the synced backup.
- **Translate "Draft" button missing.** Open **Settings** and choose Local
  (Docker) or Remote URL, then **Save**. With the local option, the container's
  first run downloads models — until that finishes, **Check status** / **Test
  connection** report "not reachable" and drafts will fail.
- **Docker option says "not available".** Install Docker Desktop and make sure
  it's running, or use a Remote URL instead.
- **"Check for updates" never finds anything / the install didn't restart.**
  The check needs internet access to GitHub. The install replaces the app folder
  and relaunches a few seconds after the app exits — if your browser tab errored
  briefly, reopen it from the tray's **Open Resume Studio**. The update log lines
  are in `resume-studio.log` (§3). If an anti-virus blocks the swap helper
  script, download the new release manually instead. Set `RESUME_NO_UPDATE=1` to
  turn the feature off.
- **"Update rejected: the download did not match its published checksum."**
  The downloaded file isn't byte-for-byte what the release says it should be —
  usually a corrupted or truncated download (a proxy, a flaky connection). It
  was discarded and nothing was installed; try again. If it keeps happening,
  download the release manually from GitHub rather than forcing the update.
- **The update says "download manually" instead of offering Install.** Either
  there's no build for your platform in that release, or it publishes no
  checksum for it (older releases predate the check) — so the app won't install
  it unverified. Grab it from the release page.
