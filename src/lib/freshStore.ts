/**
 * Empty-store + fresh-store factories.
 *
 * `emptyStore()` returns the canonical "nothing here yet" shape (resume:null,
 * empty arrays). `freshStore()` returns the same shape but with a scaffolded
 * `resume` object — what the user gets when they pick "Start fresh".
 *
 * Both are pure (no IDs, no timestamps captured at module load) so they can be
 * called from anywhere — the store action, the picker create flow, tests.
