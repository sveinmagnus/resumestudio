/**
 * PURE: when a view runs over its page limit, propose what to CUT.
 *
 * Strictly advisory, and strictly subtractive. The obvious "help me fit this"
 * feature is to have a model shorten the prose — and that is precisely the
 * failure mode this app refuses: rewriting a CV to fit invents claims the user
 * then has to defend. So the model is only ever asked WHICH ITEMS to drop, never
 * to touch a word of the content. Applying a suggestion routes through the
 * view's existing `excluded_item_ids`, which is the same reversible, per-view
 * mechanism the item checkboxes already use — the master CV is untouched.
 *
 * The input is the item catalog (ids + titles), not the rendered prose: choosing
 * what to cut needs to know what's there and how relevant it is, not the full
 * text of every description. That keeps the prompt small enough for a local
 * model and sends less of the CV.
