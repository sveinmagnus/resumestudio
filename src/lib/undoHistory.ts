/**
 * Snapshot-based undo/redo history with burst capture.
 *
 * Pure and timer-free so it can be unit-tested in isolation. The React hook
 * (`store/useUndoRedo`) drives it: it calls `onMutation()` with the
 * pre-mutation snapshot on every user change, schedules a debounce, and calls
 * `commit()` when the debounce elapses (or `flush()` immediately before an
 * undo/redo).
 *
 * ── Burst capture ──
 * A run of mutations with no commit between them collapses into ONE undo
 * step that reverts the WHOLE burst. We do this by remembering only the
 * FIRST pre-mutation snapshot of a burst and ignoring later ones until
 * `commit()` banks it. (Remembering the *last* snapshot instead — the
 * obvious-looking version — would make undo revert only the final keystroke
 * of a burst and silently lose the pre-burst state.)
