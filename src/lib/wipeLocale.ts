/**
 * Delete every value attached to a given locale from a ResumeStore.
 *
 * Pure function. Walks the resume in one pass — for every LocalizedString
 * value (top-level, nested in arrays, nested in arrays of arrays), drop the
 * entry for the wiped locale. Also removes the locale from
 * `resume.supported_locales`.
 *
 * The use case: a CVpartner import often pulls in `int`/`en` content even
 * when the consultant only ever wrote in Norwegian. The completeness drill-
 * down then shows every field as 99% missing in the unused locale.
 * Wipe-language gives the user a single button to clean up that ghost
 * language entirely.
 *
 * Does NOT mutate the input.
