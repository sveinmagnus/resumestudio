/**
 * Cross-language drift detection.
 *
 * Completeness answers "is this field translated at all?". Drift answers the
 * next question, the one the app's whole promise rests on: for a field that IS
 * filled in in both languages, have the two versions drifted apart — did
 * someone revise the English and forget the Norwegian?
 *
 * Pure logic, structural only. It flags SIGNALS a human should look at, never
 * "this translation is wrong" — the app has no bilingual judgment. Two
 * heuristics, chosen for signal-to-noise:
 *
 *   - **numbers** (high confidence): the set of numbers in the two versions
 *     differs. "5 years" ⇄ "3 år", a dropped "40%", a wrong year — these are
 *     real content bugs a reader would notice, and digits survive translation,
 *     so a mismatch is rarely a false positive.
 *   - **length** (low confidence): one version is far longer than the other,
 *     which often means one was expanded and the other wasn't. Languages differ
 *     in verbosity, so the threshold is generous and the finding is advisory.
 *
 * A future semantic pass (LLM via AssistRun) would slot in as a third signal;
 * these two need no backend and ship value offline. Walks the SAME curated
 * field set as completeness (`collectTrackedFields`), so both stay in sync.
