/**
 * PURE: turn a long prose description into the bullet points the app already
 * has a home for — a project's `highlights`.
 *
 * Only highlights, deliberately: a profile block's `key_points` would look like
 * the obvious second target, but that UI is DEPRECATED — the standalone Key
 * Competencies section owns those now (see the note in SimpleEditors and
 * migrate.extractKeyPointsToCompetencies). Wiring an assist into a surface the
 * app is retiring would drag it back.
 *
 * This is a RESHAPING task, not a writing one, and the prompt says so in the
 * strongest terms available: every point must be supported by the source text.
 * Summarising discards, which is safe; the failure mode here is invention, and
 * an invented achievement on a CV is one you have to defend in an interview. So
 * the model is told to drop anything it cannot ground, and the output is a
 * review list the user ticks — never a write.
 *
 * Drafts land in the PRIMARY locale only. The source is one locale's prose, so
 * anything else would be a translation the user didn't ask for — the existing
 * Draft-translation path owns that.
